		Recently, I have been interested in exploring various aspects of AI security, including the reliability and robustness of machine learning models, data security and privacy protection in big data environments, and the decision control of reinforcement learning and intelligent agent robots. Our goal is to reveal the vulnerabilities of these models and raise awareness, advocating for increased research dedicated to AI security.
