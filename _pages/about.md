Hi! I am Yalun Wu (吴亚伦 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student  at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zhen Han](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/5608/) and [Wenjia Niu](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9120/). 

My main research interest is Autonomous Driving (AD) Security with a focus on the security of AI components, e.g., localization, control and perception. More specifically, my research aims at discovering vulnerabilities that can be practically demonstrated in the real world as well as defending against such AI component-level vulnerabilities from the AD system perspective. 

<!--.Prior to my Ph.D. career, I graduated with a M.S. from Beijing Jiaotong University, advised by Dr. [Endong Tong](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9306/).-->



<span style="color:red;">I am <b>seeking exciting industry opportunities for both research and applications after Ph.D. graduation (June 2026)</b>. Please feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:wuyalun1@bjtu.edu.cn" target="_blank">email</a> if you are interested!</span>

<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>

Currently, my research has centered on

* **AI Security**: Security, Reliability, Robustness of machine learning or deep learning models.

* **AD Security**: Autonomous Driving (AD) Security, Intelligent Transportation and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Security.
