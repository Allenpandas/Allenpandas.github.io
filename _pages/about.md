<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Yalun Wu (Âê¥‰∫ö‰º¶ in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student  at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. Zhen Han, Wenjia Niu and Dr. Endong Tong. 

My main research interest is Autonomous Driving (AD) Security with a focus on the security of AI components, e.g., localization, control and perception. More specifically, my research aims at discovering vulnerabilities that can be practically demonstrated in the real world as well as defending against such AI component-level vulnerabilities from the AD system perspective. 

Currently, my research has centered on

* **Safety Testing**:  testing and evaluation for autonomous driving algorithms, modules, and systems.

* **Data Augmentation**: image or video generation, especially focus on generative data augmentation (GDA) in autonomous driving scenarios.

* **Autonomous Driving Security**: attacks and defenses against the physical world, sensors, algorithms and automonous driving systems.

* **Reinforcement Learning**: safety reinforcement learning (SRL), robustness reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning for autonomous driving systems.

I am always looking for related colaboration. If you are interested to chat with me, feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:wuyalun1@bjtu.edu.cn" target="_blank">email</a>.
